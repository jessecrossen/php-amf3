AMF3 encoding/decoding extension for PHP
========================================

Description
-----------

The PHP AMF3 extension provides two functions to use in PHP scripts:

string amf3_encode(mixed $value)

- Encodes $value into an AMF3 byte-stream.
- On success, returns an AMF3 representation of the value.
- On error, returns FALSE and issues a warning message
  (the only error case is wrong argument count).

mixed amf3_decode(string $amf3 [, int &$count [, $map = 0 ]])

- Decodes $amf3 (AMF3 byte-stream) into a PHP value.
- On success, returns a resulting PHP value.
- On error, returns NULL and issues a warning message.
- If $count is provided, the number of bytes actually read from the string
  will be stored in it (the value of -1 indicates an error).
- If $map is 0 (class mapping is off), AMF3 objects are returned as plain PHP
  associative arrays. Otherwise, class mapping is made according to the mode
  bits set. The following bit combinations can be used in a PHP script:
    AMF3_MAP
      Perform class mapping (no autoloading).
    AMF3_AUTOLOAD
      Perform class mapping (with autoloading).
    AMF3_CONSTRUCT
      Call the default constructor of a decoded object's class.

  WARNING! The class mapping feature should be used with great care since it
  can potentially lead to a breach in security.


Installation
------------

To install the extension, type the following in the source directory:

phpize
./configure --enable-amf3
make
make install

This should install the extension to your default PHP extension directory.
If it doesn't work as expected, manually put the target amf3.so library to
what the 'extension_dir' variable in your php.ini points to.
Add the following line to the corresponding extension section in your php.ini:

extension=amf3.so

To run tests, type:

make test


Usage constraints
-----------------

- PHP NULL, boolean, integer, float (double), string, array and object values
  are fully convertible back and forth to their corresponding AMF3 types.
- AMF3 Date becomes a float value whereas XML, XMLDocument and ByteArray
  become strings.
- In a special case, PHP integers are converted into AMF3 doubles according
  to the specification (see the link below).
- A PHP array is encoded as a sequence (dense array) when it has integer
  keys that start with zero and have no gaps. In all other cases, an array is
  encoded as a plain associative array to avoid ambiguity.
